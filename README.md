# Soccer Club

This is a fullstack project to control matches on a soccer championship.

Here you can create, update and mark matches as finished, once the match is marked as finished the leaderboard updates to include the values of the match.

Front-end was provided by trybe, back-end was all built from scracth.


## Install and Run

Nothing to worry here, all you need is docker

```bash
  # clone the repo
  cd Soccer-Trybe
  npm i
  docker compose up
```

Then just go to localhost:3000 in the browser and it will be working :)
    
## Screenshots

I user a pattern for commits that makes them easily readable and faster to understand changes that were made!

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Here is an example of how they work:
